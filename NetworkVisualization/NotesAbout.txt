TO Future programmer:

This project contains the cytoscape.js interface as well as code to generate the json file by querying wikidata.
To edit the interface code use the code.js file.  

To create the json file:
createjson_allquery_nocounts.py- this still needs further optimization to run on the local instance of wikidata and some formating to get the edge data to print correctly to the output json file.  
Included in the create_json directory is a list of queries that are used for this project as well as queries that I planned to add to this project. Toward the end of the file are queries for getting information for the egdes that is not yet implemented.
